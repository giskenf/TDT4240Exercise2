## Step 1
In this exercise I've chosen to use task 1 from the previous exercise as my code base.
## Step 2 - Implementation of Singleton pattern
The GameStateManager keeps track of the game states. There will only be one instance if the GameStateManger and thus it is implemented as singleton.
For the other classes to make use of the gsm, the MyGdxGame.java-file had to use the new getInstance() function to get the gsm.
